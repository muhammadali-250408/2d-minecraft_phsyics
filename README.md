# 2d-minecraft_phsyics
This is a project I intend to use for my A level computer science project, it is a 2d version of minecraft where physics is the main mechanics  for example you will need full supports in a house to prevent it from falling

==ADDED CONTENT==
- Breaking blocks

==BUG FIXES==
- Slow running fixed by changing physics calculation from (/60*60) to just /60
- Player now falls due to gravity when no blocks under

==THINGS THAT WILL BE ADDED IN NEXT UPDATE==
- Creating blocks
- Breaking Trees
- Player Sprite (Animated)

==BUGS TO FIX==
- Player can walk through adjacent walls
