# 2d-minecraft_phsyics
This is a project I intend to use for my A level computer science project, it is a 2d version of minecraft where physics is the main mechanics  for example you will need full supports in a house to prevent it from falling

- The project is not optimised at all all world generation, pysics, text display, and player movement and input is handled in 1 loop which wont finish till all of these are done
- As a result it may run on average at 500 fps however it will feel very slow
- I am working on making the code use threading to fix this issue

== NEXT UPDATE == 
- Breaking Blocks
- Threading
